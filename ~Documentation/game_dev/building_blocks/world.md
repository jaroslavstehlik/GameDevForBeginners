# World

Our game would be pretty unplayable without a proper game world or environment. 
The purpose of our environment is to create boundaries where the player can or cant move.
Mazes can get pretty uninteresting because how they look similar to each other.
The reason why it is hard to orient your self in a maze is that mazes are missing
important environmental queues.

Worlds can be dissected in to several parts.
