# Camera
Without a proper camera in our game we would be unable to see the player or the world.  
A camera is trying to mimic a physical camera in real world.
It has a position, orientation, aspect ratio and field of view.

When we talk about cameras in games we usually refer to their behavior.
Individual camera behaviors can change the whole genre of the game, therefore it can be coined
as one of the most important building block in our game.

Most common camera behaviors in games

***Red Dead Redemption***\
<img src="../../img/red_dead_redemption_horse.webp" alt="red_dead_redemption_horse" height="400"/>

Advanced camera which adds certain offset from player.
The movement of the camera is called camera orbit as it orbits around the player.
When the camera detects collision between player and camera it comes closer to prevent occlusion.
It allows custom distance from player by using mouse scroll wheel.
