# Timers
Timers are essential blocks for timing certain events. Certain portions of gameplay can be restricted by a timer. Super Mario Bros has a level timer by which the player has to finish the level, otherwise he dies. Super Smash Bros has a match timer which limits the duration of a match during which players have to defeat one another.

Timers play an essential role in many aspects of game play. Spawner has a timer which tells when a certain object or enemy spawns. Spells have very often cooldowns a timer which tells for how long does the player have to wait until they can activate the spell again.

They can be specified by the number of cycles.
