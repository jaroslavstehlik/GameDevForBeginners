This GitHub repository is dedicated to explain the fundamentals of game development to absolute beginners, with no prior experience required. The game engine we are using is Unity, but the concepts them selves are compatible across any game engines.

# Game dev building blocks

This section explains individual building blocks of most games.
Individual chapters describe specific topic from game design perspective,
they are sorted based on priority and also provide source code examples.

Each topic has a unity scene with examples.
