## Constants

Do not change during application runtime

```csharp
5; // is a whole number
5.5f; // is a floating point number
5.5; // is a double precision floating point number
's' // is a single character
"this is a plain text"; // is a string
```

While constants might be assigned to a variable 
they appear on the right side from the = equal symbol.
```csharp
int fiveInt = 5;
float fiveFloat = 5.5f;
double fiveDouble = 5.5;
char plainChar = 's';
string plainString = "this is a plain text";
```

They can also appear directly as a parameter of a function.
```csharp
MyFunctionTakesInt(5);
MyFunctionTakesFloat(5.5f);
MyFunctionTakesDouble(5.5);
MyFunctionTakesChar('s');
MyFunctionTakesString("this is a plain text");
```
