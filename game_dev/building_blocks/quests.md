# Quests
Many RPG games have quests or objectives. Most modern games even if they are casual and don't represent them selves as RPG games have some sort of objectives.

A quest is basically a task and a quest log is just a Todo list.
Quest needs a unique name so it can be easily understood by the player but also remembered by the game it self that it has been already completed. 

Quest can be defined in the project it self.
